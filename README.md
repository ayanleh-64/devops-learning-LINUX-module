DevOps Learning - Linux Module
This repository contains my practical exercises, notes, and challenge solutions from the Linux module in the CoderCo DevOps course.

What I learned
Navigating and managing the Linux file system
Understanding file permissions and ownership
User and group management basics
Process management and monitoring
Networking essentials and SSH usage
Environment variables and shell basics
Hands-on security and command-line challenges with OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 1 to 20)
OverTheWire Bandit Journey (Levels 1 to 20)
I completed the first 20 levels of the Bandit wargame, which provided practical experience in:

Command-line navigation and file operations
Text processing using tools like grep, sort, uniq, and diff
Handling various file formats, encodings, and compressions (base64, ROT13, hex, gzip, bzip2, tar)
Working with file permissions and ownership to find restricted files
Establishing and managing network connections with nc (netcat) and openssl for SSL/TLS
Using SSH with private keys and non-interactive commands to bypass login restrictions
Identifying and utilizing setuid binaries for privilege escalation
Combining all these skills to solve progressively complex challenges
SAD Server Challenges
I’ve worked through some of the SAD Server scenarios, a Linux-based security challenge that involves investigating a compromised system and restoring its integrity. So far, I’ve completed the first three challenges:

"Saint John" – Investigated what process was writing to a suspicious log file (Fix – No Registration) ✅
"Saskatoon" – Analyzed and counted IP addresses from logs to find malicious actors (Do) ✅
"The Command Line Murders" – Solved a mystery using only the command line (Do – No Registration) ✅
These challenges have further sharpened my skills in log analysis, forensic investigation, and bash scripting, simulating real-world DevOps and security troubleshooting scenarios.

This journey has greatly improved my Linux command-line proficiency and prepared me for more advanced DevOps and security tasks.
