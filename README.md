# Linux Module – CoderCo DevOps Course

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and challenge solutions from the Linux module of the CoderCo DevOps bootcamp.

## 📌 What This Module Covered
During this module, I developed a strong understanding of Linux fundamentals through hands-on tasks and troubleshooting scenarios. Key areas included:

- Navigating and managing the Linux filesystem
- Understanding permissions, ownership, and access control
- User and group creation and administration
- Process monitoring and management
- Networking basics and effective SSH usage
- Shell environments, variables, and command history
- Applied command-line practice through real challenges

## 🎮 OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 1–20)
I completed the first 20 levels of the Bandit wargame, which reinforced my command-line knowledge through practical, puzzle-style challenges.

**Skills built while completing Bandit:**
- File navigation and manipulation
- Searching and filtering text using tools such as `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `diff`
- Extracting information from encoded and compressed files (base64, ROT13, gzip, tar, bzip2, hex)
- Investigating and resolving permission-related issues
- Connecting to remote services using tools like `nc` (netcat) and `openssl`
- Using SSH keys and non-interactive SSH commands
- Understanding and utilising setuid binaries for privilege escalation
- Combining multiple Linux concepts to solve increasingly complex tasks

## 🔎 SAD Server Challenges
I also worked through several SAD Server scenarios, which simulate real-life DevOps troubleshooting and security incidents.

Challenges completed:
- **Saint John** – Identified a suspicious process writing to a log file
- **Saskatoon** – Investigated log entries and isolated malicious IP addresses
- **The Command Line Murders** – Solved a full investigation entirely through Linux CLI tools

These challenges improved my practical skills in log analysis, bash scripting, and system investigation.

## 🚀 Reflection
This module significantly improved my confidence working with Linux. The combination of structured lessons, wargame puzzles, and realistic troubleshooting scenarios provided essential experience for future DevOps-focused topics in the course.
